# Gastrointestinal-Tract-Images-Multiclass-Classification-using-CNN

## Project Overview

This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify medical images.The project uses Python and TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the CNN model.The aim of this repository is identify and classify 8 different types of images of gastrointestinal tract medical dataset. With 80 epochs, a validation accuracy of 71%.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this project contains the following classes:

1. Dyed and lifted polyps
2. Dyed resection margins
3. Esophagitis
4. Normal cecum
5. Normal pylorus
6. Normal z-line
7. Polyps
8. Ulcerative colitis
Each image has been preprocessed for training, validation, and testing.


## Results

The model achieved the following metrics:
Final Training Accuracy: 73%
Final Validation Accuracy: 71%
Final Training Loss: 0.75
Final Validation Loss: 0.80
Confusion matrices and classification reports are used to evaluate performance on the test set.
